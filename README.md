"# Django" 

ORM is an acronym for the object-relational mapper. The ORM’s main goal is to transmit data between a relational database and application model. The ORM automates this transmission, such that the developer need not write any SQL.

ORM, as from the name, maps objects attributes to respective table fields. It can also retrieve data in that manner.

In the above image, we have some Python objects and a table with corresponding fields. The object’s attributes are stored in corresponding fields automatically. An ORM will automatically create and store your object data in the database. You don’t have to write any SQL for the same.
ORMs automatically create a database schema from defined classes/ models. They generate SQL from Python code for a particular database. ORMs let the developer build the project in one language that means Python.


This increased the popularity of ORMs and web-frameworks. There are different ORMs available in the market but one of the best is Django ORM.

Not only ORMs, but there are also multiple Python Connectors for databases available. These ORMs use connectors to connect databases with a web application. you have to install the connector of a specific database you want to work with.
